
# 'Aquarelle' and 'Pastel' syntax highlight themes

Both are balanced and colorful syntax highlight themes:

* Aquarelle is a light theme with saturated colors and a neutral white background.
* Pastel is a dark theme with reduced color saturation and a slight bias towards pale greens and sepia base colors.

Both accentuate operator characters and minimize font style variation, instead relying on color tone and value to differentiate syntax elements. They have a relatively small palette, so the themes can be consistently reproduced in different IDEs and text editors.
